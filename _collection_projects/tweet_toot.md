desc: "Tweet-Toot is a small Python3 project to convert a tweet to a toot. It's basically a Twitter relay for Mastodon. The way it works is this: add Tweet-Toot as a cron job, and it will repost new tweets to any Mastodon account you configure. Just clone this repo, configure the script, add it to a cron job, and it will get cracking."
