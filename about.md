			I was eleven years old when Yahoo first introduced email in India. I remember creating my account, sending emails to everyone I knew, and I was fascinated by how easy communication had become. My love affair with computers had begun.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the next few years I became as deeply involved in the field as I could. I joined my high schoolâ€™s computer competition team, then experimented with programming and web technologies, and later architected and deployed several enterprise-class applications with a team of awesome professionals. All of this opened new doors for me when it came to not only what I worked on, but how I worked on it. I've learnt a lot along the way, and I'm happy to say the journey is not yet over.
